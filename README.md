# FIFEMLab

**Forward and Inverse Finite Element Laboratory**

## Description
FIFEMLab provides user friendly Matlab tools for solving PDEs in dimension 2 with the Finite Element method and for soving inverse parameters problems. It helps to 

1. Simply define of various 2D domains (stable)
2. Generate and manipulate triangular meshes (ongoing work)
3. Solve classical scalar and vectorial PDEs and manipulate their solutions (ongoing work)
4. Solve some inverse parameters problems (ongoing work)

It is fully object oriented in order to make the code as clear as possible. It has been designed primarily for educational purposes.

It requires the Matlab pde toolbox and (for some fonctionnality) the image processing toolbox. 

## Documentation

[Domain documentation](https://github.com/seppecher/FIFEMLab/blob/main/documentation/doc_domain.md) explains how to simply defines Domain objects. You may run doc_domain.mlx.

[Mesh documentation](https://github.com/seppecher/FIFEMLab/blob/main/documentation/mesh_domain.md) explains how to simply defines Domain objects. You may run mesh_domain.mlx.




## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
